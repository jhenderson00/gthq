SOC 2 Review: Email Retention Policy - MAJOR REVISION REQUIRED

Key findings:
- Document titled as Email Retention Policy but contains full Cybersecurity Policy
- Sections 7-23 duplicate cybersecurity policy content
- Missing specific email retention periods and schedules
- No SOC 2/NIST mappings for email retention controls (PRI1.5, MP-6, MP-7)
- GRC Framework non-compliance: title/content mismatch

Recommendations:
1. Rename to Cybersecurity Policy OR strip non-email content
2. Create email-specific retention schedule
3. Add proper SOC 2/NIST control mappings
